1.INTRODUCTION
•	This web application provides users with a seamless book search and display experience.
•	This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding, implementing and maintaining our application.
•	Leveraging the Open Library API, we've created a user-friendly interface that not only fetches book data by the title entered but also elegantly presents it to the user.
•	This documentation covers a wide range of topics, from initial setup and authentication with the Open Library API to the deployment of the application in a production environment.

2. PREREQUISITES
    Basic knowledge about python and its modules (requests, os, json, PIL, io), HTML/CSS and API (Application Programming Interface).
3. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
•	The user should type the title of the book that he/she is searching for in search tab.
•	The list of books available with the name specified in the tab gets displayed one after the other with the features including author’s name, book cover and first year of publish.
•	The book names are displayed with including author’s name, book cover and first year of publish.

4. DISPLAYING SEARCH RESULTS
•	The API typically returns results in JSON format. The data is parsed to return relevant information about the book.
•	The search results are made clickable allowing users to access detailed information about a book such as book titles, authors, publication dates, book covers, subject and languages in which the book copy is available.

5. ERROR MESSAGES AND TROUBLESHOOTING
•	Network errors (no internet connection and server errors). Apply required alternatives.
•	User-related errors (incorrect input and search errors)
•	Example: "Error 404: Book not found. Please check the ISBN and try again”. When  you encounter a 'No results found' error, try broadening your search criteria, checking for typos, or using different keywords.
